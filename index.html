        <p>Among his accolades, Mendes has won 13 SOCAN awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, eight Juno Awards, eight iHeartRadio MMVAs, two American Music Awards, and received three Grammy Award nominations. 
            In 2018, Time named Mendes as one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.
            Mendes has mainly been described as a pop and folk-pop singer. Mendes has cited John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, Justin Timberlake, and Bruno Mars as his main musical influences.
             Growing up, Mendes listened to reggae music, Led Zeppelin, Garth Brooks, and country music thanks to his parents. He expressed that his second studio album was influenced by Mayer's work while his third album was inspired by Timberlake, Kings of Leon, Kanye West, and Daniel Caesar.
              For Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone, Mendes incorporates "catchy acoustic folk-pop tunes" in his catalogue, while for Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times, "his soft, sometimes soulful pop-rock plays primarily to tweens and teenagers, but has also found traction on adult contemporary radio stations".
               In an interview with Clash magazine, Mendes stated: 
               <br>
               <br>
               <em>"I want to create anthems for people. I want to create anthems for big moments in their lives...I don't want my music to play for a few months and then go away forever. And not only that, I want to do incredible things that make a difference too. I think it's not only about the music you release, it's about the things you do while you're making the music."</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                In October 2018, Mendes, together with producer Teddy Geiger, released a cover of "Under Pressure" by the British rock band Queen and David Bowie.
                The single was part of a series of covers of Queen's songs, released in celebration of Queen's biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.
                The proceeds from the single were donated to the Mercury Phoenix Trust, an organization founded by Queen bandmembers after Freddie Mercury's death, which helps fight against HIV/AIDS.
                Queen's manager, Jim Beach, expressed his gratitude to Mendes and Universal Music Group for helping the cause.
